0. Testing the solution/function
1. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop
2. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case
3. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
